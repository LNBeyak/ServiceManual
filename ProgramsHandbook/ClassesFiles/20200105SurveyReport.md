Hi everyone!

Here is what we have learned from the Learning Survey.

Overall people are more interested in learning about Advanced Data Science Techniques:

Among Advanced Data Science Techniques people are interested most in Using Text for Models closely followed by Neural Networks.

Among Basic Data Science techniques people are most curious about Decision Trees, closely followed by Clustering methods.

In terms of format, most people are interested in workshop format (59%), while the rest of the people are interested in meetup format (35%). Only one person expressed interest in the book study group format, so it seems that the last format is harder for people to attend and we should probably not invest into it.
