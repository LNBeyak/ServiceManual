## Why We Are Here
Momentum Learning is a great supporter of the Data Scientista Society. Learn about their coding boot camp at https://www.momentumlearn.com/. 

## Parking
Probably any of the American Tobacco Campus parking decks will do (https://americantobacco.co/your-visit/). We recommend the south deck at 705 Willard Street.

## Finding Momentum
Momentum Learning is in the basement of one of the American Tobacco Campus buildings. To get there, find the restaurant Cuban Revolution, which is open both to the outside and to the interior of the building. Find the staircase near the interior entrance and descend. Walk down the hall, and Momentum classrooms will be both on the left and the right.
