# Invitation To Be a Featured Speaker

The Data Scientista Society is seeking volunteer speakers, both for online and local meetings. 

## Refer to Mission and Vision
All talks should support [mission and vision] (../missionvision.md) of the Data Scientista Society.

## Code of Ethics

All speakers for the Data Scientista Society are asked to abide by the Code of Conduct. By agreeing to speak at the Data Scientista Society event, they agree to hole the following values:

### Integrity
We believe the best way to build trust between a Data Scientista and her company, a Data Scientista and her manager, and a Data Scientista and her customers, is through honesty and integrity. We believe in presenting the true picture to our employers and stakeholders and reporting errors as soon as possible, so that everyone would know that if a Data Scientista says something, it can be believed.

### Growth Mindset
We believe the best way to be the best version of our professional selves in data science is to always be curious about new algorithms, new methods, and new tools. We believe that learning never stops; and if you decide to become a Data Scientista, the first thing you can do is to embrace the fact that you will always be learning new things.

### Best Practices
We believe the best way to do what we are doing has probably already been invented and is known to the community. This is why the community develops “lessons learned” which it calls “best practices”. We believe that following best practices in data science, software engineering, and security will make our code, our designs, and our models the best they can be.

## Schedule 
Online meetings are typically 6:30 to 8:30 p.m on the third Thursday of the month with the portion devoted to the speaker, including Q&A, from 7-8. 

Local meetings vary.

## Submittals
Speakers need to submit the following two months before the scheduled speaking date:
* a catchy title for the talk 
* a pitch or abstract of the talk
* a short bio
* a picture
These inputs will be used to produce a posted event on Meetup.

## Topics and Audience Size
The largest online meeting we have ever had was attended by 50 people. The limit of attendees is 250. A local meeting may be technicall held online, but with the target audience of the local group. 

Given the Society's mission, speakers are encouraged to  produce their best talks at times,  but at other times take the opportunity for experimentation and growth. So we suggest the following formats:
* A memoir-style talk about the context, highs, lows, challenges, achievements, and inspirations in your career: your story.
* Is there a data woman that you are a fan of? Tell us about her.
* A technical talk, either overview or how-to information 
* A project presentation
* A talk about career growth in the data field
* BONUS any of the above with a woman partner! 

Particularly for local meetings, we encourage a tone of
* Casual
* Friendly, nurturing, neighborly
* Educational
