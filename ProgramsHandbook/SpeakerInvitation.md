# Invitation To Be a Featured Speaker

The Data Scientista Society is currently perusing the Member List to searching for potential speakers for 2020. The Society is home-grown, member-driven, with 300+  LinkedIn profiles of local women collected and many deep relationships at its core. In the past 4.5 years, we've launched, developed regular programming, held over 75 meetings, and become a 501c3. You can read the mission and vision [here](../missionvision.md).

## Topics and Formats
The subject of your talk can be anything that demonstrates your love of data! Here are the suggested formats:
* A memoir-style talk about the context, highs, lows, challenges, achievements, and inspirations in your career: your story.
* Is there a data woman that you are a fan of? Tell us about her.
* A technical talk, either overview or how-to information 
* A project presentation
* BONUS any of the above with a woman partner! 

## Tone
* Casual
* Friendly, nurturing, neighborly
* Educational

## Audience
You can expect between 10-30 women to attend your talk.  At meetings, we tend to see regulars, university women, and women in career transition. We regulars want to be a good example to the unversity women and a resource to the women in transition, but every womam among us wants to learn and grow. And everyone is hoping to meet her next best friend at the meeting. About 60% of the listed members have master's degrees or beyond. About 80% of the women acheived their undergraduate prior to 2013. 

If you would like more information about our members, we can pass you the member list.

## When and How Long
Meetings are always 6:30 to 8:30 p.m, with the portion devoted to the speaker, including Q&A, from 7-8. This audience loves participation, so a 30-minute talk with the remaing 30 minutes for unscripted conversation is not unheard of. Meetings are on the last reasonable Monday of the month, but a meeting can be held on a different night, according to the speaker's convenience. We recommend the 2nd or 3rd Thursday of the month.

## Where
Given the current circumstances, all meetings are currently held online through Zoom.

## Helpful Things
It's helpful to submit a casual bio (e.g., do you love dogs? cats? ) and a casual abstract ("Ever wonder...") and a photo of yourself two months ahead of the meeting.
