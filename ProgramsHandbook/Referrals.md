## *The QuickList*

Create the Quicklist monthly, either on Week 2 or Week 3 of every month, as suggested by [Calendar](../Policies/Calendar.md). 

Use first names, and use the LinkedIn profile as an underlying hyperlink for any first names.

Most of the input for the Quick List comes from the survey completed at each meeting. To create the Quick List, use any survey entries for the past two months. (Of course, if we miss a Quick List, got back for 3 months.)

## Checklist of Headings for the QuickList
