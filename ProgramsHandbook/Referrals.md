## The QuickList

Create the Quicklist monthly, either on Week 2 or Week 3 of every month, as suggested by [Calendar](../Policies/Calendar.md)


You will need:
- [ ] Access to QUICK LIST Monthly Survey Questions (Responses)
- [ ] Random requests from others to put something in the QuickList
- [ ] When you send the QuickList out on Month N, Week 2, the meetings for Month N and N+1 should already be listed on Meetup; you will need the hyperlinks to those meetings


### Use previous month's code
- [ ] In the QuickListDrafts folder, duplicate the latest file and rename it
- [ ] Leave in place most of it
- [ ] Leave in place any lines with the tag <!--00-->
- [ ] Leave in place any chunks with the tag <!--n-1-->
- [ ] Clean out chunks with the tag <!--n-2--> as they are too old. 
- [ ] Any new material will get the tag <!--n--->


### Anna's Tips for Preparing the Data
- [ ] Access the monthly attendance data QUICK LIST Monthly Survey Questions (Responses)

- [ ] Delete questions 1, 4, 5, 14, as the answers don't go into the QuickList
- [ ] Delete any NOs, highlight any answers
- [ ] Wrap all cells
- [ ] Highlight any new people
- [ ] You may not know first names; they may not be apparent from email address. So use the LinkedIn Profile.
- [ ] Make all the changes as indicated by the latest data.
