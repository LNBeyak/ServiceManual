        The mission of the Data Scientista Society is to educate women pursuing careers related to data science in techniques and competencies needed for career advancement and achieving leadership positions in the field.
</p>

<h6 class="mdc-typography--headline6">How do we achieve this mission, <i>really</i>? </h6>
    <p class="mdc-typography--body1">
        The <i>modus operandi</i> of the Data Scientista Society is to build relationships among co-located women enthusiastic about data, a.k.a data scientistas, while also practicing mutual supportiveness towards competency, success, and leadership.

<h6 class="mdc-typography--headline6">What happens to these contributions?</h6>
        <p class="mdc-typography--body1">
            A funding plan is published online. The bulk of the funds will go towards meeting space rentals and app & platform fees. 
            As a proper 501(c)(3) organization, we will have a treasurer’s report at every meeting, and perform many other customary legal and financial duties. 
            While this formality is extra work, we believe it best positions us to achieve or our mission and grow.
            <br><br>
            All organizational work is on a volunteer basis. Our officers and their understudies are intensely cooperating to divide the duties. 
      </p>
