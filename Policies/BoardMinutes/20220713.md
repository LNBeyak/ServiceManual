#### Integrity

We believe the best way to build trust between a Data Scientista and her company, a Data Scientista and her manager, and a Data Scientista and her customers, is through honesty and integrity. We believe in presenting the true picture to our employers and stakeholders and reporting errors as soon as possible, so that everyone would know that if a Data Scientista says something, it can be believed.
 
#### Growth Mindset

We believe the best way to be the best version of our professional selves in data science is to always be curious about new algorithms, new methods, and new tools. We believe that learning never stops; and if you decide to become a Data Scientista, the first thing you can do is to embrace the fact that you will always be learning new things.

#### Best Practices

We believe the best way to do what we are doing has probably already been invented and is known to the community. This is why the community develops “lessons learned” which it calls “best practices”. We believe that following best practices in data science, software engineering, and security will make our code, our designs and our models the best they can be.
