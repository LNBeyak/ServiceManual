## North Carolina Center for Non Profits
Jaronda reported that some NC Center for Non Profits webinars were of interest. 

## Secretary Resignation
The chair announced she had accepted the resigniaton of Maria Martovska, Secretary. 4:56 Jaronda offered that the VP role could assume the role of taking minutes at board meetings. The group advised to ask for a volunteer with Python, Pandas skills to help with the newsletter, highlighting that it is a resume item. 

## InHerSight
Anna shared about[InHerSight](https://www.inhersight.com/) demo, offering that this company does not charge for its service, aggregates data about satisfactory employment for women, and helps women find jobs. There is was no ask at this time. 

5:10 The group brainstormed a large event in early 2022 featureing InHerSight and someone like Jessica from Momentum.

## General Discussion
The board discussed the feedback to continue to meet virtually and in-person simultaneously. While other groups are facing similar requests, the board believed that the webinar format required complex equipment, more teleconferencing infrastructure, and someone with special expertise in orchestration. The board reviewed the intention to meet in Raleigh and Durham and RTP, rotationally. The board wondered about the priorities behind the request, whether the update excercise and interpersonal connections were important, or access to the speaker. The board preferred a champion to start and grow a virtual chapter. 

Anna promised to reconfigure Meetup so that other board members were more aware of new Meetup members.

## Adjournment
5:29 Anna motioned to adjourn the meeting. Jaronda seconded. Motion passed unanimously.
