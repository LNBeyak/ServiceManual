# Calendar

## Calendar Structure

The standing meetings are on the last reasonable Monday of the month from 6:30 to 8:30 pm, but not in November or December.

All programming should be in place one month before hand. This should be easy because our programs alternate.

So, After a standing meeting (0th week) in Month 0:

Month 1, Week 1
* Open/remind the applicable survey [Feb, Apr, Jun, Aug, Oct: Bookclub survey; others, speaker survey.]

Month 1, Week 2
* Close the survey and create the meetup event 

Month 1, Week 3
* Issue the Quick List 

Month 1, Week 4
* Remind about meeting with attendance survey [PRESIDENT]
