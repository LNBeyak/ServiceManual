# Funding Plan for 2020

See also [Reasons for 501(c)(3)](../Policies/501c3.md)

## Basis
We have a concept of the budget unit, which is the standing rate for space rental for one hour. 

The budget unit is currently at $50.

We have a standard for engagement, the percentage derived from the number of participants divided by the total number of members.

The engagement standard is set at 10%

## Dues Pay Committed Expenses
Annual dues are set to one unit (so $50 per year).

Annual dues are collected via a private Meetup group called [Data Scientista Society Funders](https://www.meetup.com/DataScientistaSocietyFunders/). This is an additional, optional group, not for managing meetings (and their tickets), but for managing dues and contributions.

The administrator approves membership.

Anyone who does not pay the dues within 90 days is purged from the role.

Registrants are asked to declared whether they will be FOUNDING members or CONTRIBUTING, the former being those making their membership official with dues, and the latter being allies who are donating for whatever reason, but not paying annual dues. Contributors are an excellent source for Meetup dues for those who cannot afford them (i.e., out of work)

Meetup charges a processing fee according to a schedule. 

This private meetup group is configured so that transactions submitted through Meetup are transparent.

### Expected Dues
We believe we have 300 members. At the current engagement standard, we aim for 30 founding members.
30 members * $50 = $1500 

We do not know how much in contributions we will receive.

### Expected Comitted Expenses
Expenses will be paid, prioritized by the listing at [Inventory](Inventory.md)

| Expense | Amount |
|----------------------------------------|----:|
| 6x 3-hr meetings at Rebusworks @$50/hr | $900 |
| Meetings at Momentume Learn | $0 |
| Meetup.com | $200 |
| Website | $200 |
| Margin | $200 |

## Tickets Pay for Program Events
Occasionally there are ticketed events. A nominal fee helps plan for attendance, and may cover costs associated with that event. See [ProgramsOverview](../ProgramsHandbook/ProgramsOverview.md) for approved expenses. 

We recognize that many groups are configured with a discount for members. Unfortnately, Meetup does not allow tier-priced ticketing. One work around is to create two Meetup events, one for founding members, and one for general. 

The standard for membership discounts per ticket is 25%.
